File Description:
--------------------

This file contains data cleaning and visualization. It contains functions that reduce original data file to contain only relevant information such as FIPS and Food Insecurity rate, visualize Food Insecurity rate and cost per meal countrywide, visualizes how household type and race impact Food Insecurity rate, and more. Also, we implemented a pipeline that selects the same factors from multiple files, which allows efficient analysis of annual changes.
