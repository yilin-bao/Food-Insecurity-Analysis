test\_ProjectCodeCombine module
================================

File Description:
-------------------

This file contains tests for all functions we used. For example, we ensure the column names are correct in the dataset fed into the visualization function draw_FIrate(), it must be pd.DataFrame with a shape of (28282, 3), and columns 'FIPS', 'Rate of Food Insecurity', 'year'. In addition to this test, we also ensure the output types and information of other functions.
